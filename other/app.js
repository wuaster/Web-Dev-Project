Vuetify\'s documentation is also quite clear and concise, saving time for developers that are new to the framework.',
        message2:'Unlike a lot of the other JS frameworks, Vue.js offers a very simple integration as a lot of the web page\'s components can be held within a considerably small pool of files. Hence making it much easier to reuse and modify components when working on new projects.',
        message3:'Furthermore, Vuetify\'s base layout is considerably easy for users to navigate and quite pleasing to the eye without necessarily being overpowering. When it comes to material design, Vuejs is a great option as it allows users to easily create designs that are both visually appealing as well as functional.',
