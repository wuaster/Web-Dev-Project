                <p style = "font-family: Calibri; text-align:left">My experience with Vue and Veutify was interesting and went very smoothly.
                     One of the pivotal reasons I enjoy using Vuejs is because it is relatively easy to understand. Vuetify\'s documentation 
                    is also quite clear and concise, saving time for developers that are new to the framework.</p>
                <p style = "font-family: Calibri; text-align:left">Unlike a lot of the other JS frameworks, Vue.js offers a very 
                    simple integration as a lot of the web page\'s components can be held within a 
                    considerably small pool of files. Hence making it much easier to reuse and modify components when working on new projects.</p>
                <p style = "font-family: Calibri; text-align:left">Furthermore, Vuetify\'s base layout is considerably easy for users to 
                    navigate and quite pleasing to the eye without necessarily being overpowering. When it comes to material design, 
                    Vuejs is a great option as it allows users to easily create designs that are both visually appealing as well as functional.</p>

                <p style = "font-family: Calibri; text-align:left">My experience with Flask also went very smoothly. 
                    Flask is a web application framework written in python</p>
