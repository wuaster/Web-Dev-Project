        <h2 style = "font-family: Calibri; text-align:center">My Experience With The Frameworks</h2>
        <br>
        <p class= "blocktext text">My experience with Vue and Veutify was interesting and went very smoothly.
             One of the pivotal reasons I enjoy using Vuejs is because it is relatively easy to understand. Vuetify\'s documentation 
            is also quite clear and concise, saving time for developers that are new to the framework.</p>
        <p class= "blocktext text">Unlike a lot of the other JS frameworks, Vue.js offers a very 
            simple integration as a lot of the web page's components can be held within a 
            considerably small pool of files. Hence making it much easier to reuse and modify components when working on new projects.</p>
        <p class= "blocktext text">Furthermore, Vuetify's base layout is considerably easy for users to 
            navigate and quite pleasing to the eye without necessarily being overpowering. When it comes to material design, 
            Vuejs is a great option as it allows users to easily create designs that are both visually appealing as well as functional.</p>
        <br>
        <p class= "blocktext text">My experience with Flask also went very smoothly. 
            Flask is a web application framework written in python. It was initially difficult to configure, however as we progressed it became easier to use.
            The integration of Flask and html was a little tricky at first since when using flask it is common practice to use a template.html file and inherit the contents for all other html files.
            Subsequently, the syntax to integrate flask and python in the rest of the html files was a learning curve but made it easier in the long run. Overall, as we further worked with 
            flask it became easier to use.</p>
