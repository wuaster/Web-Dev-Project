        <br>
        <p class= "blocktext text">My experience with Vue and Veutify was interesting and went very smoothly.
             One of the pivotal reasons I enjoy using Vuejs is because it is relatively easy to understand. Vuetify\'s documentation 
            is also quite clear and concise, saving time for developers that are new to the framework.</p>
        <p class= "blocktext text">Unlike a lot of the other JS frameworks, Vue.js offers a very 
            simple integration as a lot of the web page's components can be held within a 
            considerably small pool of files. Hence making it much easier to reuse and modify components when working on new projects.</p>
        <p class= "blocktext text">Furthermore, Vuetify's base layout is considerably easy for users to 
            navigate and quite pleasing to the eye without necessarily being overpowering. When it comes to material design, 
            Vuejs is a great option as it allows users to easily create designs that are both visually appealing as well as functional.</p>
        <br>
        <p class= "blocktext text">My experience with Flask also went very smoothly. 
            Flask is a web application framework written in python</p>
